This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using Python and deep learning frameworks, trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000 images. It demonstrates preprocessing, CNN architecture design, training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions. The goal is to achieve high accuracy while providing a simple and reproducible workflow for beginners in deep learning and computer vision.
